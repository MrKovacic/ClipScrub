# ClipScrub

ClipScrub is a simple windows application that runs in the background (no active window). The purpose is to scrub and possibly alter the text you copy. For example, if you copy text from a website and paste into a work document, ClipScrub can strip that text of all fonts, sizes, and colors. You can also have it remove extraneous line breaks, change everything to uppercase or lowercase. 

This is the first real release and I plan to add more functionality moving forward.
